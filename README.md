# BarProject

# This is our readme file for the BarBeerDrinkers project

# To generate data you will need to download these csvfiles in the same folder as the code to run:
# transactionids.csv, drinkers.csv, bars.csv, items.csv, and beers.csv
# With these four files all other files will be created by running the python files in this order:
# sells.py, likes.py, and frequents.py can be run in any order
# pays.py
# sales.py
# contains.py
# subtotals.py
# billstimes.py
# we used copy and paste on excel to create the final bills.csv file;)
